## Misc

Nested types can only be declared in primary declaration.
- Simplifies qualified name lookup because extensions cannot define new nested types.
- Makes sense in the context of scoped conformances because the definition of a type in an extension may break someone else's code. (not so compelling because of properties?)

Make a distinction between extensions and givens.
- An extension reopens the scope of a type and adds new members.
- A given exposes a conformance.

Let `a.m` be an expression where `a` has type `T`, we may resolve `m` to an entity introduced in the primary declaration of `a` or in an extension of `a`, but not to an entity introduced in a given.
If `m` denotes a trait requirement, then name resolution should bind it to the entity introduced in the trait, qualified by a witness of `a`'s conformance to that trait.   
    

## Ideas for optimizations

- Store the contents of "small" type trees in the inline storage of their identities.
- Use a separate array to store the tag of each syntax tree rather than calling `tag(of:)`.

## Questions

- Is it desirable to write extensions of context functions?
